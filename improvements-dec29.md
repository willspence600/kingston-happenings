    * Then liked upcoming events  
* Add a **bell icon** to:  
  * Notify via SMS or email when an event is coming up

---

## **Email Database**

* Is there a way to store all emails and phone \#s so we can see how many users there are?

---

## **Admin Workflow Improvements**

* Admin approval:  
  * Should require **one click** (or double-click on same button) instead of “are you sure you want to approve” every time  
* Recurring events:  
  * Admin should approve **once**, not each instance  
* Ability to list event as canceled and not delete
