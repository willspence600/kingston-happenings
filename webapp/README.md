## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Go to **Settings > API** in your Supabase dashboard
4. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon/public key**

### 3. Create the Profiles Table

The app stores user roles in a `profiles` table. Run the SQL setup script:

1. Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-setup.sql` (in the webapp folder)
4. Click **Run**

This creates:
- A `profiles` table with `id`, `role`, `name`, `venue_name` columns
- RLS policies so users can only access their own profile
- A trigger to auto-create profiles when users sign up

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `webapp/` directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration (Required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Database (Prisma - for events/venues)
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

### 5. Set Up Local Database

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# (Optional) Seed with sample data
npm run db:seed
```

### 6. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## User Roles

The app supports three user roles:

| Role | Description | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Event-Goer** (`user`) | Regular users | Browse events, save favorites |
| **Organizer** (`organizer`) | Event organizers | Submit events, manage their submissions |
| **Admin** (`admin`) | Platform administrators | Approve/reject events, manage all content |

### Setting Yourself as Admin

After signing up, you can promote yourself to admin via the Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Table Editor** → **profiles**
3. Find your row (look for your name or user ID)
4. Click on the row to edit it
5. Change the `role` column from `user` or `organizer` to `admin`
6. Press Enter or click outside to save

**That's it!** Refresh the app and you'll have admin access.

> **Note**: Normal users cannot change their own role through the app - this can only be done via the Supabase dashboard, which is protected by your Supabase credentials.

### Creating the Admin Account (Alternative)

If you prefer to create a dedicated admin account:

1. Register a new account in the app (e.g., `admin@kingstonhappenings.ca`)
2. Go to Supabase **Table Editor** → **profiles**
3. Find the new user's row and set `role` to `admin`

## Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up**: Users choose Event-Goer or Organizer role during registration
2. **Profile Created**: A profile row is created in `profiles` table with chosen role
3. **Sign In**: Email/password authentication via Supabase
4. **Role Loaded**: App fetches role from `profiles` table
5. **Session Persistence**: Sessions persist across page refreshes
6. **Sign Out**: Clears session and returns to logged-out state

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing Supabase environment variables"
Make sure you have created `.env.local` with the correct Supabase URL and anon key.

### "Invalid login credentials"
- Check that the email and password are correct
- Ensure the user exists in Supabase Auth

### Admin can't access admin dashboard
1. Go to Supabase **Table Editor** → **profiles**
2. Verify your row has `role` set to `admin`
3. Try logging out and back in to refresh the session

### "relation 'profiles' does not exist"
You need to run the SQL setup script. Go to Supabase **SQL Editor** and run the contents of `supabase-setup.sql`.
