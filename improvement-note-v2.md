- On the event creation page, the Start Time and End Time input fields are very frustrating to use – the user must select the hour, minute, and PM/AM field separately for both fields. It should be much easier - consider a different time selection component to improve the user experience.

- The ticket/registration link field on the event submission page requires that users add "https://" before the link. They should also just be able to type the link, e.g. ticketmaster.com/event/abc

- After clicking on the username in the top left corner of the header, the only option that appears in the popup is "My Liked Events". This button should have the text "My Events" instead.

- Some of the alerts are defaults, which does not look very modern and doesnt fit in with the theme (e.g. when logging in and not having a valid username input). Make the alerts fit with the theme, maybe using custom components.

- The share buttons aren't working on my friend's laptop or phone. Fix this.
