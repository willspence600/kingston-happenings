- Make it so that organizer accounts have a "my events" page that allows them to view events they have submitted. Include when they submitted the event, approval status (i.e. pending, approved), etc

- When I submitted an event on an organizer account, it said it was submitted and is awaiting approval. But when I logged into the admin account to approve the event, I didn't see the event listed. Also, I created a new venue when i was creating the event, but this new venue didnt show up either. The admin account should have to approve new venues too. 
    - Furthermore, I just tried to create an event on the admin account, and it didnt work either. It should automatically be created without approval on an admin account. It seems the event creation does not work at all, so fix this functionality so that new events persist in the database and are immediately displayed in the UI.

- When creating events, there shouldnt be a field for "Event Image URL". Instead, it should be a file input field, so that users can drag images or select them from their file explorer.

- When creating events, the organizer should have the option to create multiple at once. Directly above the "Submit Event for Review" button at the bottom of the page, there should be a "Submit Another Event" button. When this button is clicked, it should add another form at the bottom of the page (this will push the "Submit Event for Review" button to the bottom of the page).

- Make it so that when a user is logged in, the homepage displays something like "Welcome <first name>"

- Make it so that you cant submit an event unless you log in.

- The admin account should be able to delete events.

- Add a 19+ filter/category
